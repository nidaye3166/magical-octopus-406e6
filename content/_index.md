##### About

I am a Research Scientist for Autonomous Systems, where my field of endeavor lies in detection, classification and tracking of dynamic/static objects using information mainly from camera, Radar and Lidar systems, as well as data fusion for the multi-sensor systems:

*   **Sensor Fusion**: homogeneous/heterogeneous track/data fusion (T2TF); track/data association (T2TA); Multi-layer sensor fusion; data intermediate representation; multi-stage fusion with/without feedback.

*   **Tracking**: KF/EKF/UKF/PF; interacting multiple model (IMM); extended object tracking.

*   **Localization/Mapping**: dynamic occupancy gridmap; Doppler-based localization; GraphSLAM.

*   **Statistics**: hypothesis test; sufficient/complete/ancillary statistics.

*   **Optimization**: convex optimization; expectationâ€“maximization (EM); pattern search.

*   **Estimation**: Bayesian data analysis; observability/estimability analysis; Monte Carlo sampling; finite mixture models; hierarchical estimation.
